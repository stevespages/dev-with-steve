Git Github Deploy
=================

Track with Git
--------------

Having created a directory (with or without contents such as an Express app) you can set up git to track any changes in the directory. Create a .gitignore file containing files and directories you do not want to track. For an express app this would include the node_modules directory and any config files that contain sensitive data such as passwords. Now issue the ``git init`` command from the root directory. Then issue  ``git commit``
