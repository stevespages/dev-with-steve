.. Dev with Steve documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Mon Jun 17 15:21:45 2019.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. I intend to have the `toctree` in contents.rst and use the index.rst
   page as a home page.
