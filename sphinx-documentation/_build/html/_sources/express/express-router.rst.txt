express.Router
==============

Routes and the handlers associated with them can be defined in `app.js`. This could lead to a very large file. A router can be created as a module. This can have middleware as well as some routes. A Code Example is given here of a router with one route in it and no middleware.

Code Example: :doc:`different-route <./express-router-different-route>`
